The report should be 4-6 pages and include descriptions of (1) the problem,
(2) your approach, and (3) your results.  Please highlight the planning aspects
and other course concepts in all of the sections.  You may want to include some
references to related work in the background for your problem description or in
the evaluation of your results, but you do not need to include a separate
related work survey.
